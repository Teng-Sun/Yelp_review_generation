## How to Run
If you are only interested in playing with the trained model to generation reviews, download the trained model weight from [here](https://github.com/Tony607/Yelp_review_generation/releases/download/V0.1/pre-trained.hdf5)  and put it to the root of the project directory.
Start notebook
